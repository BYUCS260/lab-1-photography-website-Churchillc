          <p> I am a student attending Brigham Young Univeristy, and this is a lab for my CS260 class.
            I am not a photographer in any way. Everything you see on this website was taken by someone else. But I did write the html and the CSS
            for this website.</p>
          <br>
          <p>
          I am majoring in Computer Science - Animation Emphasis.  I am currently the gameplay lead on my senior capstone project,
          a videogame called Soul Shepherd.  I am also a tennis coach for Centennial Elementary School. I enjoy doing parkour and playing guitar.
          I never really take photos.</p>
          <br>
          <p>
          I don't really have much else to say here, I have never really been good at talking about myself, and I don't really want to get stuck on that,
          so I am just filling in the space with some more words here.  This picture is a size that I like for the layout of this page, but now I want it to be semetrical
          so that means I need more content to put over here.
          </p>
          <br>

          Notice how my hair is black in this photo?  Yeah I'm blond.  I dyed it for an acting job about a year ago, and I don't know why I thought it was a good idea to do a nice photo
          shoot when my hair was temporarily dyed.  But oh well.  I like this picture.
